The goal of this project is to create a system for managing blood donors and blood banks  that may be used to donate blood. The Blood Bank Management System can be used to obtain information about nearby blood donors who belong to the same blood group to assist those who require blood in an emergency. People who are interested in donating blood can register on the blood donor website with the aid of Blood Donor. The Website displays the location of the nearby Blood camp so that the Donor can easily get there.

There are two main elements to the Blood Bank Management System: NGO and hospital.

The software may be used to register the NGOs running the  camp. Then, they may add information about the camp, such as its location and the number of seats available. The information about the camp run by an NGO is available on the blood donor webpage. The Hospital that needs blood may quickly register with software, acquire the blood donor's information from the blood donor webpage, and request blood from an NGO.
A link between the hospital and NGO is created via the blood bank management system. They are both interconnected in a way that makes it easy to complete our assignment as soon as possible.
