# Blood Buddies   ❤️

# watch Demo video ↓

The goal of this project is to create a system for managing blood donors and blood banks  that may be used to donate blood. The Blood Bank Management System can be used to obtain information about nearby blood donors who belong to the same blood group to assist those who require blood in an emergency. People who are interested in donating blood can register on the blood donor website with the aid of Blood Donor. The Website displays the location of the nearby Blood camp so that the Donor can easily get there.

There are two main elements to the Blood Bank Management System: NGO and hospital.

The software may be used to register the NGOs running the  camp. Then, they may add information about the camp, such as its location and the number of seats available. The information about the camp run by an NGO is available on the blood donor webpage. The Hospital that needs blood may quickly register with software, acquire the blood donor's information from the blood donor webpage, and request blood from an NGO.
A link between the hospital and NGO is created via the blood bank management system. They are both interconnected in a way that makes it easy to complete our assignment as soon as possible.


## Problem Statement
As more people become aware of the need to donate blood for 
those in need, the percentage of individuals donating blood is 
rising daily. In order to prevent any detrimental consequences 
on the blood recipient after receiving blood, the blood must be 
carefully maintained. It was discovered from the observations 
collected during the user requirements phase that there 
is no communication channel for the general public to notify 
their blood donation schedule. The public is often made aware 
of the blood donation campaign period by advertising the 
blood donation event calendar. Only the nurses and staff at the 
blood home unit are notified about the blood donation schedule 
for each month since it is written on a whiteboard there. 
Therefore, they are manually notifying the timetable.
When there is enough space, a problem occurs. The whiteboard 
Is the medium used to communicate the staff's monthly schedule, 
and whiteboard marker is used to write it. As a result, the writing 
frequently becomes confusing. Blood donation was not well 
known by the general public.
The BBMS interface will be built to accommodate the NGO 
staff posting about the blood donation activities in order to 
manage these. The general public may access these facts so   they 
are aware and can plan time to go and give blood. The NGO staffs 
will have access to a form where they can fill out the specifics 
and a list of the locations for each month's blood donation 
activities, ensuring that everyone is aware of the schedule.
Due to the existence of this feature in the BBMS, it is simpler 
for the staff to amend any inaccurate information. and make the 
necessary adjustments if the provided location or date are altered.

## Features
The Blood Buddies is the one that will be created. This is a web-based application solution that donors can use. The shortcomings of the 
existing system are overcome by this system.


- Registered users/donors locate nearest blood camp
- It provides security for users using username and passwords.
- GPS systems are used to track the nearest location of blood camp
- Health care services is an area with strict requirements as it refers 
To human life [7]. Blood Donor is a website-based solution that is
designed to store process, retrieve, and analyses information. The 
website enables users to save donation information there. 
A special identifying number is immediately provided to the donor 
as soon as they register. At the time of the donor details, the physical 
and medical information of the donor is stored. The donor can 
check the neighboring camp on the internet. On the webpage, 
the              c         amp location is shown using Google Maps. Registration is 
also finished at the blood camp to prevent having to do it again at 
the donation camps. The donor gets access to all information about 
the camp and can edit his user profile since the history of his 
camp registration is also shown. Additionally, Authors provide 
a support system where the donor    may turn if they have any 
inquiries concerning the blood camp. The ranking system on 
the website ranges from 1 to 10. Blood donation frequency can 
enhance the level, which might lead to intense competitiveness 
among young people.

## CONCLUSION

A trustworthy platform is provided for both donors and acceptors 
by the proposed Blood Bank Management System. A web-based programmed called "Blood Buddies" helps to reduce human 
mistake and issues with data redundancy. The data entered will 
be followed to ensure, increasing the likelihood that someone's life 
may be saved. As a result, it is a quick and effective way to 
communicate without security risks. Additionally, it is easier to 
discover the closest blood camp thanks to a location-based system 
that is available, such as Google Maps.

## FUTURE SCOPE

This paper proposes a Blood Bank Management System and 
Blood donor website which Authors believe will bring remarkable 
change. support for numerous regional languages to accommodate 
the increasing number. Authors will create a portable, customized 
Blood donor-based Android application over the next phase.
